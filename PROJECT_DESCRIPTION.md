# ðŸ“˜ Project Description: Ecommerce SQL Analysis

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the **Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset** using SQL.  
The dataset contains information about customer orders, order items, payments, freight, and delivery timelines.  

The goal is to explore **business insights** such as customer distribution, payment preferences, freight costs, delivery performance, and year-over-year growth.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Objectives
The project addresses the following key business questions:

1. **Evolution of Orders**
   - How many orders are placed month-on-month?
   - Which states contribute the most to order growth?

2. **Customer Distribution**
   - How are customers spread across different cities and states?

3. **Payment Trends**
   - What are the different payment types?
   - How does the number of orders vary month-on-month by payment type?

4. **Revenue Growth**
   - What is the total payment value in 2017 vs 2018?
   - What is the percentage increase in revenue from Janâ€“Aug 2017 to Janâ€“Aug 2018?

5. **Freight and Delivery**
   - What is the average freight cost per state?
   - How long does it take (on average) for an order to be delivered in each state?

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology
1. **Dataset Import**  
   - Data tables: `orders`, `order_items`, `payments`, `customers`.  
   - Platform: Google BigQuery (can be adapted to other SQL engines).

2. **Data Exploration**  
   - Extracted time-based features (Year, Month) using `EXTRACT()`.  
   - Calculated aggregate metrics such as `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`, `AVG(freight_value)`, and `SUM(payment_value)`.

3. **Business Analysis**  
   - Delivery performance measured as difference between `order_purchase_timestamp` and `order_delivered_customer_date`.  
   - Revenue growth calculated using **window functions (`LAG()`)** for year-to-year comparison.  
   - Payment type analysis grouped by month.
